Take an array and remove every second element from the array. Always keep the first element and start removing with the next element.

Example:
```python
my_list = ['Keep', 'Remove', 'Keep', 'Remove', 'Keep', ...]
```
```ruby
my_arr = ['Keep', 'Remove', 'Keep', 'Remove', 'Keep', ...]
```
```javascript
myArr = ['Keep', 'Remove', 'Keep', 'Remove', 'Keep', ...];
```
```scala
myArr = List("Keep", "Remove", "Keep", "Remove", "Keep", ...)
```
```php
$array = ['Keep', 'Remove', 'Keep', 'Remove', ...];
```
None of the arrays will be empty, so you don't have to worry about that!
