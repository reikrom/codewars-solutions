Get the number n ```(n>0)``` to return the reversed sequence from n to 1.

Example : n=5 >> [5,4,3,2,1]

*NOTE: In NASM, the function signature is* `int *reverse_seq(int n, size_t *size)` *where the first parameter* `n` *is as described above and the second parameter* `size` *is a pointer to an "out" parameter which should be set to the size of the array your function returns (which should be equal to* `n` *if your implementation is correct).*
