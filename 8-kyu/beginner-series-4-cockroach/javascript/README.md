The cockroach is one of the fastest insects. Write a function which takes its speed in km per hour and returns it in cm per second, rounded down to the integer (= floored).

For example:

```python
cockroach_speed(1.08) == 30
```
```csharp
CockroachSpeed(1.08) == 30
```
```javascript
cockroachSpeed(1.08) == 30
```
```coffeescript
cockroachSpeed(1.08) == 30
```
```haskell
cockroachSpeed 1.08 == 30
```
```java
cockroachSpeed(1.08) == 30
```
```ruby
cockroach_speed(1.08) == 30
```
```prolog
cockroach_speed(1.08, 30).
```
```cfml
cockroachSpeed(1.08) == 30
```
```c
cockroach_speed(1.08) == 30
```
```cpp
cockroach_speed(1.08) == 30
```
```factor
1.08 cockroach-speed 30 =
```
```pascal
CockroachSpeed(1.08) = 30
```

Note! The input is a Real number (actual type is language dependent) and is >= 0. The result should be an Integer.
