You must implement a function that return the difference between the biggest and the smallest value in a list(`lst`) received as parameter.

The list(`lst`) contains integers, that means it may contain some negative numbers.

If the list is empty or contains a single element, `return 0`.

The list(`lst`) is not sorted.

```javascript
maxDiff([1, 2, 3, 4]); // return 3, because 4 - 1 == 3
maxDiff([1, 2, 3, -4]); // return 7, because 3 - (-4) == 7
```
```python
max_diff([1, 2, 3, 4]) # return 3, because 4 - 1 == 3
max_diff([1, 2, 3, -4]) # return 7, because 3 - (-4) == 7
```
```ruby
max_diff([1, 2, 3, 4]) # return 3, because 4 - 1 == 3
max_diff([1, 2, 3, -4]) # return 7, because 3 - (-4) == 7
```

Have fun!
